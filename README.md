# 🧠 Lifemaxxing Tracker

A personal full-stack web app for tracking and optimizing key life goals — from fitness and finances to social reach and habits.

Built with **React** (Vite + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI) on the frontend and **FastAPI** (SQLModel + SQLite) on the backend.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This app is designed to help you "lifemaxx" — track growth across key dimensions of self-improvement:
- 📈 Followers (LinkedIn, IG, etc.)
- 💸 Financial milestones (income, savings, net worth)
- 💪 Fitness (lifting stats, weight, bodyfat)
- 🧠 Programming (hours spent programming, etc)

It's a private dashboard meant for daily/weekly input and reflection — the kind of data you'd normally forget.
